We have a dataset of sales of different TV sets across different locations.
Records look like:
Samsung|Optima|14|Madhya Pradesh|132401|14200
The fields are arranged like:
Company Name|Product Name|Size in inches|State|Pin Code|Price

7. Write a Map Reduce program to view the total sales for each product for every Company corresponding to each size.
Make sure that all records for a single company goes to a single reducer and inside every reducer, keys must be sorted
in descending order of the size.
You may write a custom WritableComparable for this purpose.
